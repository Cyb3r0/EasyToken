v0.90 - 2014/07/26

 - Rework handling of bound device IDs during token import.  Try to guess
   it based on the current (unique) device ID and all known class GUIDs.
   Allow the user to override it, in case of a collision.

 - Limit import string to 64kB to avoid OutOfMemoryError crashes on invalid
   tokens.

v0.81 - 2014/07/06

 - Fix bug in lock screen widget where it would "bounce" between the tokencode
   display and the clock display for no apparent reason

 - Show the "confirm import" screen unconditionally, so there is a clear
   indication that email import succeeded

v0.80 - 2014/07/05

 - Initial public release
